Renewal should occur automatically.

PWA Caching and Update
----------------------
By default, a user has to browse to another site (or kill the
app) for the service worker to update the files over the network - else
content will be served from the cache.

Folders
-------
Images should be  ./Images/book_name/4by3/page4x3_x.jpg (or similar for 16by9 )
Audio folder should be: ./Audio/book_name/language/audio_file.mp3 

Languages
---------
Language selection is via the config file. The app will look
for the relevant json file (i.e. if en -> story_en.json)
For each story, you need to:
1. update the language in the config file.
2. place the story_xx.json file in the Json directory
3. replace the images and audio files (make sure the story_xx.json points to them).
4. Update the manifest file (app name)
5. Update the service worker to point at the correct json file.
