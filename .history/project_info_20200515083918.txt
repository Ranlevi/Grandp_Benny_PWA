PWA Caching and Update

By default, a user has to browse to another site (or kill the
app) for the service worker to update the files over the network - else
content will be served from the cache.

Folders
-------
All audio, images and json files should be in the /assets directory.
A specific folder structure and file naming is required:
Images should be  ./Images/book_name/4by3/page4x3_x.jpg (or similar for 16by9 )
Audio folder should be: ./Audio/book_name/language/audio_file.mp3 

Book Selection
---------
For each story, you need to:
1. update the book name & language in the index file.
2. update the book name & language in the service_worker file.
