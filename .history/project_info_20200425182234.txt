Gradpa Benny PWA app
----------------------
Author: Ran Levi
Version: 1.0

This is a PWA built with Swiper JS and Bulma.io. 
It is designed as a single common app that can be customized
for different stories and langutes based on json files.

Server 
######
Ubuntu, Running Apache2
domain: books.love.science

Connecting to the server:
-------------------------
Use putty to connect via SSH.
Need to use private SSH key in folder /SSH Auth
Use CyberDuck to conncet via FTP with same credentials.

Setting up HTTPS:
-----------------
Used CertBot to enable https on the server. Instructions -
https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuother-apache

Renewal should occur automatically.

PWA Caching and Update
----------------------
By default, a user has to browse to another site (or kill the
app) for the service worker to update the files over the network - else
content will be served from the cache.

Folders
-------
Each story has it's own folder on the server (e.g. /moon_en/)

Languages
---------
Language selection is via the config file. The app will look
for the relevant json file (i.e. if en -> story_en.json)
For each story, you need to:
1. update the language in the config file.
2. place the story_xx.json file in the Json directory
3. replace the images and audio files (make sure the story_xx.json points to them).
4. Update the manifest file (app name)
