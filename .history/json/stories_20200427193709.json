This is a stone I brought back from the moon many years ago.’ replied Grandpa Benny. ‘From the moon? Really?’ asked David in surprise. ‘Yeah, sure. I flew there with Eagle, the big, gray parrot.

One day, a very strange package arrived at the post office: there was a small, white egg inside it. On the package was written: 'To Buzz Aldrin, the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA.׳ \nHow strange. I'd never heard of someone sending an egg by mail....but a package is a package! I carefully put the egg in my mailbag inside a cotton-padded pocket, and off to Florida I went.״",

When I got closer to the tower, I saw that it was a very strange building. It was completely round, and had no windows. Clouds of white smoke emerged from under the tower. \nI scratched my forehead in amazement. 'Is this Buzz Aldrin's house?' I thought to myself, 'I've never heard of someone living in a tower like this. Where's the door? How do you get in?' I saw a blue arrow, and decided to follow where it pointed around the tower.",

And I climbed, and climbed! Another floor and another floor...I puffed heavily like an old steam engine. The stairs twisted around the tower, and I couldn't see the end of it. The ground was far beneath me, and the people below looked as small as ants.\nI finally found myself in front of a small, round door. I wiped the sweat off my forehead, arranged my hat and knocked on the door. 'Who's there?' a voice from the inside asked.",

And who are you, if I may ask?' ‘We are Buzz, Neil and Michael and we're astronauts.' they replied, introducing  themselves. 'Astronauts?' I asked, 'what do you mean?...’ Before they could answer, there was a deafening sound – like a lion's roar – maybe even a dinosaur's. The entire room began to tremble! \n‘Hold on tight Benny,’ Buzz said to me, ‘we're taking off!’ ‘Taking off?! Where to?’ I asked. \n‘To the moon, of course!’ replied the astronaut. ",

They told me that the name of the shuttle was 'Apollo 11'. \nBuzz looked at the egg that I gave him. ‘It's from my uncle,’ he said, ‘he researches birds in the South American forests, and once in a while, sends me interesting specimens.

And if not to the moon, then maybe to Mars. I heard that it's really nice there too. But now it's getting late, and we must get ready for bed.’ \nGrandpa Benny and the two children entered the house.

Collins remained in the spacecarft's Command Module, while Armstrong and Aldrin descended to the lunar surface in the Eagle Landing Module.
