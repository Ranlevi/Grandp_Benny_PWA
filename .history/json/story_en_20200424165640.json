What do you say?’\n‘Yes! Feed the parrots! Feed the parrots!’ called Maya and David excitedly. ‘Great,’ Grandma Rosa smiled, ‘now please sit at the table.’",

The three parrots happily  squawked and pecked at the fruits with their beaks. \n‘Grandpa,’ asked Maya, ‘what is that round, black stone at the corner of the cage?’  ‘This? This is a stone I brought back from the moon many years ago.’ replied Grandpa Benny. ‘From the moon? Really?’ asked David in surprise. ‘Yeah, sure. I flew there with Eagle, the big, gray parrot. I haven't told you about my trip to the moon?’ ‘No! Tell us!’ urged David and Maya.",

One day, a very strange package arrived at the post office: there was a small, white egg inside it. On the package was written: 'To Buzz Aldrin, the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA.׳ \nHow strange. I'd never heard of someone sending an egg by mail....but a package is a package! I carefully put the egg in my mailbag inside a cotton-padded pocket, and off to Florida I went.״",

When I got closer to the tower, I saw that it was a very strange building. It was completely round, and had no windows. Clouds of white smoke emerged from under the tower. \nI scratched my forehead in amazement. 'Is this Buzz Aldrin's house?' I thought to myself, 'I've never heard of someone living in a tower like this. Where's the door? How do you get in?' I saw a blue arrow, and decided to follow where it pointed around the tower.",

And I climbed, and climbed! Another floor and another floor...I puffed heavily like an old steam engine. The stairs twisted around the tower, and I couldn't see the end of it. The ground was far beneath me, and the people below looked as small as ants.\nI finally found myself in front of a small, round door. I wiped the sweat off my forehead, arranged my hat and knocked on the door. 'Who's there?' a voice from the inside asked.",

And who are you, if I may ask?' ‘We are Buzz, Neil and Michael and we're astronauts.' they replied, introducing  themselves. 'Astronauts?' I asked, 'what do you mean?...’ Before they could answer, there was a deafening sound – like a lion's roar – maybe even a dinosaur's. The entire room began to tremble! \n‘Hold on tight Benny,’ Buzz said to me, ‘we're taking off!’ \n‘Taking off?! Where to?’ I asked. \n‘To the moon, of course!’ replied the astronaut. ",

Planet Earth moved farther away beneath us.’ ",

They told me that the name of the shuttle was 'Apollo 11'. \nBuzz looked at the egg that I gave him. ‘It's from my uncle,’ he said, ‘he researches birds in the South American forests, and once in a while, sends me interesting specimens. Benny, will you please watch the egg for me until we return to Earth?’ I happily obliged. I love animals.",

On the second day of the journey we heard tapping from inside the egg. After a while, we saw a small beak sticking out of a crack in the shell, and then a small, cute chick with gray feathers and a yellowish beak broke through. We decided to call him 'Eagle'. Eagle and I got along wonderfully from the beginning. I fed him, petted his soft feathers and brushed him, and he would rub against me and eat breadcrumbs from my hand. We became good friends.’",

The small chick looked at me nervously, as if he understood that something was wrong. 'Eagle, you have to help us!' I said, pointing to the air tank.

Neil and Buzz walked on the moon, and visited the various craters on its surface. \n‘Why didn't you join them, Grandpa?’ asked David. ‘Because I didn't bring a space suit,’ explained Grandpa Benny. ‘You see, I didn't think we'd take off to the moon!’. ‘And were you jealous of them?’ asked Maya. ‘A little,’ Grandpa admitted, ‘but Neil and Buzz brought me a present when they returned to the spaceship: the shiny, black moon stone you saw in the cage.’",

And if not to the moon, then maybe to Mars. I heard that it's really nice there too. But now it's getting late, and we must get ready for bed.’ \nGrandpa Benny and the two children entered the house.

Collins remained in the spacecarft's Command Module, while Armstrong and Aldrin descended to the lunar surface in the Eagle Landing Module. Armstrong landed the Eagle in an area known as 'The Sea of Tranquility', which was thought to be relatively clear of large rocks. Armstrong and Aldrin spent about 2.5 hours on the Moon, conducting several experiments and collecting rocks to bring back to Earth.",
